            <p>One thing many people think of when they consider "nice weather" is how many clouds are in the sky. One cannot get a sunburn without the sun beating down on their skin. If we go closer to the Equator, do we have a greater chance of few clouds and more sun? Well, the graph above has quite a story to tell.<br/>
            Our graph as latitude on the x-axis, with 0 being the Equator and North indicated by postive latitudes and South indicated by negative latitudes. The y-axis has the % of clouds in the sky. We are seeing no clear pattern in the cloudiness related to one's latitude. Rather, the nice clustering of dots towards the bottom with the smattering of dots across the graph indicates that all latitudes have an equal likelihood towards cloudiness, meaning you can get a great tan anywhere! But also, no matter where you go, there will always be <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cleCtBP0o5Y">clouds in your coffee...</a>
