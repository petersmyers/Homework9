            <p>Is it windier near the Equator? I know the wind comes sweeping down the planes in Oklahoma, but does it come blowing through the palms at the Equator? Based on our graphs, we have an answer to this super important question.<br/>
            We have the x-axis as latitude, with increasing values indicating moving more North, and the Equator indicated by 0. On the y-axis, we have the wind speed (in miles per hour) in various cities around the world (cuz we <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqgVXSvwGo">Mr.WorldWide</a>). No clear trend is evident. There is a smattering of higher wind gusts in the Northern cities, but whether that's statistically significant, we cannot say with this data (but you can look at this if you want!). But is this surprising? Wind tends to be based on air fronts or something. Those fronts be moving and groovin all around the globe, pushing here, caving here. Everywhere should have some sort of gustiness to it. <br>
            That said, if we were looking at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaEmQJG2HHU">tornado</a> data, we might be singing a different song
